## ⚙️ Configuration

- How to set up your spire client

##Find your Spire url
###Base URL
The base URL for the Spire API is the same url provided by Spire that you use to access Spire server and uses port 10880 as default:
Replace {spire-url} with the url provided by Spire.

- https://{spire-url}:10880/api/v2/
  
Spire Cloud
If you are using Spire cloud you do not need to specify a port. The base URL for API for Spire Cloud customers would be:

https://{spire-cloud-url}/api/v2/

### Set up your client with your credentials

```python
from spyre import Spire

client = Spire(host = 'your-spire-domain', company = 'comapany-name' , username = 'username' , password = 'password' )

```

## Example : Updating the status of an inventory item 
```python
item = client.inventory.items.get_item(1101)    # Gets item with id 1101
item.status = 1                                 # Use either item. or item.model. . item.model. will bring up all attributes
item.update()
```
